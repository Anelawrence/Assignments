# Using the structures we explained during the course of this weekâ€™s sessions:
# Create a BankAccount class
# It should have similar attributes of a conventional bank
# It should have methods that implement the deposit and withdrawal functionality of a bank account
# Test that your code is working properly
# Push your code to github

class BankAccount:
    acct_bal = 0

        self.depost = deposit
        self.withdrawal = withdrawal

        if deposit > withdrawal:
            self.acct_bal = deposit - withdrawal
        elif deposit == withdrawal:
            self.acct_bal = BankAccount.acct_bal
        else:
